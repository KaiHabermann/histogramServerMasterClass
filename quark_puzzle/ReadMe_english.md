## What is it about?
The Quark-Puzzle is a teaching aid from the field of particle and hadron physics. It is intended to help pupils/students/people interested in hadron physics to learn about the basic principles of the Strong Interaction and the Standard Model.

## Content and description
The Quark-Puzzle consists of a total of 36 different pieces (quarks), which can be 3d-printed in the designs (flavours) up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom and in their antiparticles. This information is printed on an outer side.
Due to the charge of the Strong Interaction - colour charges - all quarks are present in the three versions, which should be printed in the respective colours/anticolours (red, blue, green for matter; anti-red (cyan), anti-green (pink) and anti-blue (yellow) for antimatter) if possible. If this is not possible, the colour charge is engraved on the inside. 
The plug-in mechanism is selected so that only "colour-neutral" particles can be built, which means that the following combinations are possible:

- (Baryon): Red--Blue--Green
- (Anti-Baryon): Anti-red--anti-blue--anti-green 	
- (Meson): Anti-red--red 			
- (Meson): Anti-blue--blue 			
- (Meson): Anti-green--green 			

The binding mechanism is therefore only dependent on the colour and not on the flavour. Since the formation time of hadrons with top flavour is longer than its lifetime, they have not yet been observed (as of 07/23). This is taken into account in the puzzle, since top quarks do not have contacts and thus cannot be built up.
On the upper side of a quark there is information about the generation: (circle: first generation; tetrahedron: second generation; square: third generation).
On the side next to the indication of the flavour is an indication of the electric charge.

## How do I print the puzzle pieces?
You only need a 3D printer. We have provided each particle individually and also as a colour composition (without top quarks, as we assume fewer are needed). Import the files as STL into your manufacturer programme. The quarks have a large resolution so that the programme automatically reduces the size.

It is important to note that you reduce the particles by a percentage and NOT to exactly the same size! The parts have slightly different sizes.		
Because there are minor errors in each print result, we have taken this into account in the design. Prints with size of the long side up to 50mm (= diameter of the target object) give very good results. For prints larger than 50mm the particles do not hold together perfectly. A version for this is planned.
In our experience, it is advisable to place the side with the flavour, flat on the bottom of your manufacturer's programme, this has already been done in the composition.  

Note:

	...that the quarks are printed as best as possible in the colour of the colour charge. 
	...that after printing you remove the last remains of the print with a sandpaper/nail file/screwdriver.
	...once you have printed a version, we would be delighted to receive a picture of a hadron of your choice in front of a landmark in your city, which we would post on our Instagram channel (@quark.puzzle), mentioning your name.

## I would like to make changes to the design, is that possible?
No, we don't want that and have therefore excluded it in the licence (CC BY-ND). If you have a need for improvement or suggestions, or if you see that someone is changing the product, we would be happy to receive an email: quarks@mageta.de

## I would like to share the files - which I downloaded in the original and did not change - is that possible?
Yes, of course you can, just make sure you mention the name (CC BY-ND). The product is freely available and should please as many people interested in physics as possible!

## Which programmes were used, which printer for the tests?
Abaqus, TinkerCAD and FreeCAD were used for the construction,
successful prints on a 3D printer from Prusa 

## Notes for teachers:
In events where pupils have already built hadrons with the puzzle, the wish was expressed to know the names of the particles. Adam Morris [1] programmed a Hadron Namer, which is available at the following address: https://hadron-names.web.cern.ch/. Note that tetraquarks and pentaquarks are also included, which cannot be built with the puzzle.
We have had good experiences with giving the pupils time to find out the symmetries (e.g. colour neutrality, el. charges, Mesons and Baryons, generations, significance of the top quark) themselves (experimental learning). An initial impulse which is given in advance (e.g. that hadrons are colour neutral) can accelerate the process. Classical instruction lends itself to reflection afterwards. 

## Who to contact?
You can contact L.J. Exner at quarks@magenta.de or ask questions on the Instagram channel @quark.puzzle.

## Who are "we"?
The quark puzzle was developed by Lukas Julian Exner at the Helmholtz Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Physics at the University of Bonn with the support of Prof. Dr. Sebastian Neubert his working group and especially Dr. Klaas Padeken.

## Further
We are not liable for any damage caused by the print or the product and will not pay for any costs incurred for the material.

# We hope you have fun!
